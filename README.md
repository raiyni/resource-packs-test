## Description

A sakura themed resource pack with Kirby as its mascot.

This was first a personal pack with bare-bones changes to Snow Monarch's Pink Vanilla, but as time went on, I kept changing things and making then look more sakura-themed. This pack was originally made for my use.

I would credit whomever made the picture of Kirby sleeping on the grass but I can't find the original anywhere.
